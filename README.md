# AWS-Lambda
### What is LAMBDA?
- **Simply write your code and run it in Lambda !**
- Lambda is the **most frequently** used service in AWS since it's **serverless**!
- It frees developers from the worry of provisioning resources, specifying operating systems, managing Hardware, and performing maintenance.

## Lambda Practical Example
- AWS Lambda empowers anyone to run code without thinking about servers or underlying infrastructure (you don't have to specify **t2.medium** as an example anymore).
- AWS Lambda works as an _**orchestrator between multiple decoupled AWS Services.**_

## When to use Lambda? 
- _It's perfect for **mini tasks** that are **repeated frequently.**_
